# Part 1: Configure Devices and Verify Connectivity

## 1. Configure the PC interfaces.

- Configure the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on PC3 and PC4 as listed in the Addressing Table

## 2. Configure the router.

- Change the name of the R2 router.

      enable
      conf t
      hostname R2

- Configure c1sco1234 as the encrypted privileged EXEC mode password.

      enable
      conf t
      enable secret c1sco1234

- Configure c1sco1234 as the encrypted privileged EXEC mode password.

      (in global config)
      ip domain-name ccna-lab.com

- Disable DNS lookup to prevent the router from attempting to translate incorrectly entered commands as though they were host names.

      (in global config)
      no ip domain-lookup

- Encrypt the plaintext passwords.

      (in global config)
      service password-encryptin

- Configure the username SSHadmin with an encrypted password of 55Hadm!n.

      (in global config)
      username SSHadmin password 55Hadm!n

- Generate a set of crypto keys with a 1024 bit modulus.

      (in global config)
      crypto key generate rsa
      1024

- Assign cisco as the console password, configure sessions to disconnect after six minutes of inactivity, and enable login. To prevent console messages from interrupting commands, use the logging synchronous command

      (in global config)
      line console 0
      password cisco
      login
      exec-timeout 6
      logging synchronous
      exit

- Assign cisco as the vty password, configure the vty lines to accept SSH connections only, configure sessions to disconnect after six minutes of inactivity, and enable login using the local database.

      (in global config)
      line vty 0 4
      transport input ssh
      login local
      password cisco
      exec-timeout 6
      logging synchronous
      exit

- Create a banner that warns anyone accessing the device that unauthorized access is prohibited.

      (in global config)
      banner motd "Unauthorized Access Is Prohibited!"

- Enable IPv6 Routing.

      (in global config)
      ipv6 unicast-routing

- Configure all four interfaces on the router with the IPv4 and IPv6 addressing information from the addressing table above. Configure all four interfaces with descriptions. Activate all four interfaces.

      (in global config)
      interface g0/0/0
      ip address 10.0.4.1 255.255.255.0
      ipv6 address fe80::2:a link-local
      ipv6 address 2001:db8:acad:4::1/64
      description Connection with 10.0.4.0 network
      no shutdown

      (now repeat for the other interfaces)

- Save the running config to the startup config

      copy running-config startup-config

## 3 Verify network connectivity.

- Using the command line at PC3, ping the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for PC4. Question: Were the pings successful?

      Yes

- From the CLI on R2 ping the S0/1/1 address of R1 for both IPv4 and IPv6. The addresses assigned to the
  S0/1/1 interface on R1 are:
  IPv4 address = 10.0.3.1
  IPv6 address = 2001:db8:acad:3::1

      Yes

- From the command line of PC3 ping the ISP address 209.165.200.226. Question: Were the pings successful?
  From PC3 attempt to ping an address on the ISP for testing, 64.100.1.1.Question:Were the pings successful?

        Yes
        No: Destination host unavailable

- From the command line of PC3 open an SSH session to the R2 G0/0/0 IPv4 address and log in as SSHadmin with the password 55Hadm!n.

      (in commandline)
      ssh -l SSHadmin 10.0.4.1

      Yes it was succesfull

## Part 2: Display Router Information

- From the command line of PC3 open an SSH session to the R2 G0/0/0 IPv6 address and log in as SSHadmin with the password 55Hadm!n.

      ssh -l SSHadmin 2001:db8:acad:4::1
      55Hadm!n

- Use the show version command to answer questions about the router.
